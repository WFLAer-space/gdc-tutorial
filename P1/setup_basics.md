## Setup & basics <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

### 1. Switching On/Off
Press the "on" button located in the upper right corner to start the calculator. To turn it off, press `Ctrl` + `on`.

### 2. Selecting Options
Most options are labeled with numbers (1-9) or letters (A-Z). You can select an option by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard. Alternatively, you can navigate using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or by clicking directly on the option with the touchpad and cursor.

### 3. Using the Ctrl and Shift Keys
- **Shift Key**: This key allows you to type uppercase letters, but it generally doesn't allow you to type the blue characters above the buttons.
- **Ctrl Key**: This key is used to perform operations associated with the blue characters above the buttons. For instance, `Ctrl` + `Shift` can toggle uppercase locking.

You can use these keys either by pressing them simultaneously with other keys or by pressing them first and then pressing the desired key. When these states are active, you'll see the corresponding indicator in the upper right corner. The following screenshots show the `Ctrl` and `Shift` states.

**My advice**: Set the language to **English**. This will help you adapt more quickly to the calculatorâ€™s interface and familiarize yourself with the English mathematical terminology. Understanding these terms is crucial, as our materials only use English terminology.

To change the language setting:
 Go to the **Home Page**.
2. Select **5. Settings**.
3. Choose **1. Change Language** and set it to **English**.
