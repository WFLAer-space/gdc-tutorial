### 2 Draw Function Graphs
Let’s create a function graph:

1. Press the **Menu** button and select **Graph Entry/Edit > Function**.

 Input a function, for example, $f(x) = x + 1$.

3. Press **Enter** to draw the graph.

### 3 Zoom In and Out
To zoom in or out:

1. Press the **Menu** button and select **Window/Zoom > [Choose Option]**. For example, to zoom in:

 Drag the cursor to select the zoom center.

3. Press down the touchpad to confirm and apply the zoom.

!> If you can't see the graph of your function, adjust it by using "Zoom Fit" or "Zoom Standard," and then "Zoom Fit" again.

!> Although you are using technology to draw graphs, you still need to clearly consider what the function's graph should look like (especially the asymptotes), because the displayed image may only be a part and may not reflect all the characteristics of the graph. ~有一次考试就是集体挂在这的~


### 4 Graph Analysis
The calculator provides many graph analysis tools. Here are some examples:

#### 4.1 Find the Zero of a Function (y = 0)
1. Press the **Menu** button and select **Analyze Graph > Zero**.

![](https://vip.123pan.cn/1816233029/9440009)

 Follow the instructions to proceed:
   - Select the graph for analysis.

![](https://vip.123pan.cn/1816233029/9440013)

   - Choose the lower and upper bounds, $x_1$ and $x_2$, to define the range for the analysis.

   - Note: Only one point can be found per operation. Repeat if necessary for additional points.

#### 4.2 Find the Intersection of Two Functions ($y_1 = y_2$)
1. Similar to the zero-finding process, select **Analyze Graph > Intersection**.
 Follow the instructions to find the intersection point(s).

#### 4.3 Find the Local Maximum/Minimum of a Function
1. Select **Analyze Graph > Minimum/Maximum** (using "Minimum" as an example).
 Follow the prompts to select the graph and define the range.
3. The local minimum/maximum will be displayed on the graph.

#### 4.4 Using "Relation" tool
1. Press the **Menu** button and select **Graph Entry/Edit > Relation**.

2.Type in the relation you ant to investigate, for example $f1(x)<f2(x)$

3.Press Enter and the domain of x of this relation will be shown.


### 5 Example—Solving Inequalities Using Graphs
Example: Solve the inequality $(x+3)^5(x-2)^2(x+1) < 0$, which can be rewritten as:

$$f(x) = (x+3)^5(x-2)^2(x+1), \, f(x) < 0$$

1. Draw the graph of $f(x)$.
 It’s clear that when $x = -3$, $x = -1$, or $x = 2$, $f(x) = 0$. The graph is below the x-axis between $-3 < x < -1$.
3. Therefore, the solution is $-3 < x < -1$.

### 6 Dragging and Dropping Text and Graphs
You can drag and drop text and graphs by long pressing to select the item, then moving the cursor to adjust its position.
